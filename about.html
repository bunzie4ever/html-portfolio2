    <h1>Who is Banele Mareletse?</h1>
    <hr/>

    <p>Banele Maud Mareletse is a lot of things. To some, a caring women. To others, she might be seen as ruthless.
        All I know is that I am her and I am happy being me. I'm a creative, aiming at bringing a breath of fresh
        air to the world. Sometimes (most times) I'm too caring. I'm too understanding. I want to understand, but
        sometimes it comes at the cost of self. Honestly I'm not sure what to write here. I could list all my personality
        traits but that's not me. I am the awareness, and I guess as the awareness I'm not choosing to lie to you now and
        say I want to write things for professionalism sake. I want to write the things I want to write and that's all.
        Why lie to the world by being professional? I want to be real. Anyway, that's a short looking into how I think. Hope
        that helped you figure me out. <br/><br/> I would add a picture but I don't have one of myself right now. I'm sure you 
        know how I look though.
