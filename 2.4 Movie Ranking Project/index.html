<h1>The Best Movies In Existence According to Bunzie</h1>
<h2>My Top 5 Movies Of All Time</h2>

<hr/>
<p>
    I must be completely honest and say that I will be ranking mainly childhood movies, as I'm not the
    biggest movies fan as of right now. We'll get there one day I gues. For now, let's talk about childhood
    movies!
</p>

<h3>1. Tangled</h3>
<p>
    Tangled has to be one of my favourite movies of all time. I remember watching this movie so much as 
    a child that I'm sure I had the entire script memorised. I don't want to have an spoilers for anyone but I 
    will say that I don't like Rapunzel's mom. Also, why is there no Tangled 2?????? I need answers NOW!
</p>

<h3>2. Barbie Princess Charm School</h3>
<p>
    To be completely honest, this movie should've taken the number one spot, but I'm too lazy to change it 
    . I truly adore this movie, along with other movies like the Barbie mermaid movies but this one has to be 
    my favourite. Even thinking about it makes me want to watch it right now lol. Anyway, if you wanna make 
    the inner girl in you happy, do yourself a favour and watch this movie.

<h3>3. Spy kids</h3>
<p>
    Unfortunately one of my favourite childhood movie series is getting a lot of hate right now, and I don't 
    blame the hater. As a child, I thought I was watching peak cinema. My little eyes couldn't believe what 
    was going on on the TV screen. Now some clips ae circulating on tiktok and I'm shocked at how bad the 
    production was. I guess it was okay for that day and age, but wow I'm dissappointed. Your inner child will 
    love it tho. Apparently Spy kids 3 is really good so I'll have to watch it and get back to you guys. Bye!!
</p>

<h3>4. Gnomeo and Juliet</h3>
<p>
    Gnomeo and Juliet is easily one of my favourite childhood movies because I used to watch it nonstop. I would
    literally get home from school and watch that movie almost everyday. My mom and to plead with me to stop watching
    because I had the whole script memorised! Great movie movie for kids. 10/10 would recommend. Only childhood movie with
    consistent british voice actors too.
</p>

<h3>5. Barbie Mermaid movie</h3>

<p>
    I don't even remember which one it was specifically, but it's a duology. I remember Barbie was surfing
    and she eventually figure out she was a mermaid, but not just any mermaid... I guess that's a bit of a 
    spoiler, so hopefully I intrigued you enough to go and figure it out. Great movies!
